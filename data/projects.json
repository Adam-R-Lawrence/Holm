Developed for power and flexibility, it implements advanced numerical techniques such as RBVMS and stabilized finite element formulations, a level-set method, custom GPU-based linear solvers, and a mesh partitioning and MPI communication model for parallel CPU on multi-node HPCs. Currently closed source.",
