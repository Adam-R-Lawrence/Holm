                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I am eagerly preparing to embark on my PhD journey in computational mechanics, specifically fluid-structure
                    interaction within the Civil and Environmental Engineering department at the University of Illinois at
                    Urbana-Champaign, commencing in August 2024. Originally from Melbourne, Australia, I completed both my
                    bachelor's and master’s in environmental engineering at The University of Melbourne.</p>

                <p>On this website you will find the numerous pursuits that take up my time. From the work I am undertaking
                    during my PhD, my personal passion projects, as well as my writings on a wide range of topics that interest
                    me.</p>

                <p>I am mostly interested in high fidelity and large-scale environmental modelling. My primary coding language
                    is C++, utilizing the numerical library PetSC, developed up the road from Illinois at Argonne National
                    Laboratory. However, most of my remote sensing visualization is done in Python.</p>

                <p>Beyond my professional interests, I have a deep appreciation for geography and history, literature, and
                    languages. Reading fuels all my curiosity and imagination, and I have shared a selection of my favorite
                    books here. Additionally, I am proficient in Chinese, which I learnt by myself, for those comfortable in the
                    language, feel free to explore this website in Chinese by clicking the toggle button in the navigation
                    pane.</p>

                <p>This all cumulates into environmental storytelling, which I have formulated as an engaging, scientific way of
                    showcasing the environment and its relationship to humanity. </p>

                <p>Non-scholarly interests include that of bushwalking and Australian football, the native sport of my
                    country.</p>


                <p>If you have any enquiries or thoughts, I would be delighted to engage with you, feel free contact me through
                    any means given in the navigation pane. </p>
