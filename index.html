            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>I am eagerly preparing to embark on my PhD journey in computational mechanics, specifically fluid-structure
                interaction within the Civil and Environmental Engineering department at the University of Illinois at
                Urbana-Champaign, commencing in August 2024. Originally from Melbourne, Australia, I completed both my
                bachelor's and masterâ€™s in environmental engineering at The University of Melbourne.</p>

            <p>On this website you will find the numerous pursuits that take up my time. From the work I am undertaking
                during my PhD, my personal passion projects, as well as my writings on a wide range of topics that interest
                me.

                In my Projects section you will see, primarily the Torrentem, which has helped me develop.

                In my writing section you

                In my Publications page you will view the papers that I am currently working on and have published thus far

            </p>

            <p>My journey is defined by projects like <a href="projects.html#torrentem">Torrentem</a>, a parallel solver for multi-physics simulations; <a href="projects.html#vat-photo-polymerization">Vat Photo-Polymerization</a>, modeling additive manufacturing; and the <a href="projects.html#numerical-wave-tank">Numerical Wave Tank</a>, simulating oceanographic dynamics. Discover more on the <a href="projects.html">Projects page</a>.</p>


            <p>If you have any enquiries or thoughts, I would be delighted to engage with you, feel free contact me through
                any means given in the navigation pane. </p>
